## 1.1 Overview

This document describes the EDK II Platform Description file (DSC) format. The
EDK Build Tools are included as part of the EDK II compatibility package. In
order to use EDK II Modules or the EDK II Build Tools, an EDK II DSC and FDF
file must be used.

EDK II tools use INI style text based files to describe components, platforms
and firmware volumes. While similar to EDK DSC files, the EDK II DSC file
format is different, and new utilities have been provided to process these
files.

The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports creation of binary images that comply
with Unified EFI (UEFI) 2.5 and UEFI Platform Infrastructure (PI) 1.4
specifications.

This design has the following goals.

**Compatible**

The EDK II DSC format does not support EDK DSC format, nor can EDK tools be
used to parse the EDK II DSC format files. 

**Simplified platform build and configuration**

One goal of this format is to simplify the build setup and configuration for a
given platform. It was also designed to simplify the process of adding EDK II
firmware components to a firmware volume on a given platform.

Table 1 describes the compatibility between platform, module and component
builds.

support for different platforms. It is most likely only of interest in the
event that there is a problem with a build, or if a developer needs to perform
special customizations of a build for a platform. This document is most likely

The EDK II build processes, defined in the EDK II Build Specification, use
separate steps to create EFI images. The EDK II DSC file is used in conjunction
with EDK II Flash Description files (FDF), EDK II DEC, EDK II module INF and
EDK component INF files to generate binary PE32/PE32+/Coff files. The EDK II
Makefiles, generated by the EDK II parsing tool, contain only enough
instructions to build the PE32/PE32+/Coff image files. These makefiles do not
contain information on the EFI format for FFS or FV file creation. The
Makefiles will support third party compilation tools - Microsoft, Intel and GCC
tool chains - and at least one EDK II tool, GenFw. The GenFw tool is used to
manipulate the files emitted from the compilation tools.

The EDK II build provides UEFI and PI (Unified EFI, Inc.)
specification-compliant images.
