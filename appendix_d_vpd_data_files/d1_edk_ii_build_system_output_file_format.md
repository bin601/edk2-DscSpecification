## D.1 EDK II Build System Output File Format

The output file generated by the EDK II build system (if a `VPD_TOOL_GUID`
entry appears in the `[Defines]` section of the DSC file) is a text file.

#### Summary

The file is generated by the EDK II build system to be consumed by the tool,
specified by GUID in the `Conf/tools_def.txt` file. The file is generated in
the Platform FV directory using the GUID value of the `VPD_TOOL_GUID` for the
filename. This is a registry format GUID.
